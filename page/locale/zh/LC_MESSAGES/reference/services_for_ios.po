"The parameter will usually be a Dictionary, with the information "
"necessary to make the request, and the call will have 2 phases. First, "
"the method will immediately return an Error value. If the Error is not "
"'OK', the call operation is completed, with an error probably caused "
"locally (no internet connection, API incorrectly configured, etc). If the"
" error value is 'OK', a response event will be produced and added to the "
"'pending events' queue. Example:"

msgid ""
"Remember that when a call returns OK, the API will *always* produce an "
"event through the pending_event interface, even if it's an error, or a "
"network timeout, etc. You should be able to, for example, safely block "
"the interface waiting for a reply from the server. If any of the APIs "
