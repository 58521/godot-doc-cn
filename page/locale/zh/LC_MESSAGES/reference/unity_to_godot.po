msgid ""
"While both editors may seem similar, there are many differences below the"
" surface. Both let you organize the project using the filesystem, but "
"Godot approach is simpler, with a single configuration file, minimalist "
"text format, and no metadata. All this contributes to Godot being much "
"friendlier to VCS systems such as Git, Subversion or Mercurial."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:58
msgid ""
"Godot's Scene panel is similar to Unity's Hierarchy panel but, as each "
"node has a specific function, the approach used by Godot is more visually"
" descriptive. In other words, it's easier to understand what a specific "
"scene does at a glance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:60
msgid ""
"The Inspector in Godot is more minimalist and designed to only show "
"properties. Thanks to this, objects can export a much larger amount of "
"useful parameters to the user, without having to hide functionality in "
"language APIs. As a plus, Godot allows animating any of those properties "
"visually, so changing colors, textures, enumerations or even links to "
"resources in real-time is possible without involving code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:62
msgid ""
"Finally, the Toolbar at the top of the screen is similar in the sense "
"that it allows controlling the project playback, but projects in Godot "
"run in a separate window, as they don't execute inside the editor (but "
"the tree and objects can still be explored in the debugger window)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:64
msgid ""
"This approach has the disadvantage that the running game can't be "
"explored from different angles (though this may be supported in the "

"possible), but in exchange has several advantages:"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

"Live editing is a lot more useful, because changes done to the editor "

"Godot's scene system is different: it actually consists in a tree made of"
" nodes. Each node serves a purpose: Sprite, Mesh, Light... Basically, "
"this is similar to Unity scene system. However, each node can have "
"multiple children, which make each a subscene of the main scene. This "

"different files."

"In Unity, you would put all the GameObjects in the scene: the player, "
"multiple instances of enemies, bricks everywhere to form the ground of "
"the level, and multiple instances of coins all over the level. You would "
"then add various components to each element to link them and add logic in"
" the level: for example, you'd add a BoxCollider2D to all the elements of"
" the scene so that they can collide. This principle is different in "
"Godot."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:99

"There again, an enemy is a reusable element in other levels. It is almost"

msgid "Lastly, the Level scene."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:103
msgid ""
"It is composed of Bricks (for platforms), Coins (for the player to grab) "
"and a certain number of instances of the previous Enemy scene. These will"
" be different, separate enemies, whose behaviour and appearance will be "
"the same as defined in the Enemy scene. Each instance is then considered "
"as a node in the Level scene tree. Of course, you can set different "
"properties for each enemy node (to change its color for example)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:105
msgid ""
"Finally, the main scene would then be composed of one root node with 2 "
"children: a Player instance node, and a Level instance node. The root "
"node can be anything, generally a \"root\" type such as \"Node\" which is"
" the most global type, or \"Node2D\" (root type of all 2D-related nodes),"
" \"Spatial\" (root type of all 3D-related nodes) or \"Control\" (root "
"type of all GUI-related nodes)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:109
msgid ""
"As you can see, every scene is organized as a tree. The same goes for "
"nodes' properties: you don't *add* a collision component to a node to "
"make it collidable like Unity does. Instead, you make this node a *child*"
" of a new specific node that has collision properties. Godot features "
"various collision types nodes, depending of the use (see the `Physics "
"introduction <../tutorials/2d/physics_introduction>`_)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Question: What are the advantages of this system? Wouldn't this system "
"potentially increase the depth of the scene tree? Besides, Unity allows "
"organizing GameObjects by putting them in empty GameObjects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:113
msgid ""
"First, this system is closer to the well-known Object-Oriented paradigm: "
"Godot provides a number of nodes which are not clearly \"Game Objects\", "
"but they provide their children with their own capabilities: this is "
"inheritance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:114
msgid ""
"Second, it allows the extraction a subtree of scene to make it a scene of"
" its own, which answers to the second and third questions: even if a "
"scene tree gets too deep, it can be split into smaller subtrees. This "
"also allows a better solution for reusability, as you can include any "
"subtree as a child of any node. Putting multiple nodes in an empty "
"GameObject in Unity does not provide the same possibility, apart from a "
"visual organization."

"has a lesser importance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:127
msgid ""
"However, we often observe a common architecture for Unity projects, which"
" consists in having one Assets folder in the root directory, that "

" Materials, Scripts, Scenes, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:129
msgid ""
"As described before, Godot scene system allows splitting scenes in "
"smaller scenes. Since each scene and subscene is actually one scene file "
"in the project, we recommend organizing your project a bit differently. "

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:135
msgid ""
"The concept of prefabs as provided by Unity is a 'template' element of "

"properties as defined by the prefab."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/unity_to_godot.rst:137
msgid ""
"Godot does not provide prefabs as such, but this functionality is here "
"again filled thanks to its scene system: as we saw the scene system is "
"organized as a tree. Godot allows you to save a subtree of a scene as its"
" own scene, thus saved in its own file. This new scene can then be "
"instanced as many times as you want. Any change you make to this new, "
"separate scene will be applied to its instances. However, any change you "

"To be precise, you can modify the parameters of the instance in the "
"Inspector panel. However, the nodes that compose this instance are locked"
" and you can unlock them if you need to by clicking the clapperboard icon"
" next to the instance in the Scene tree, and select \"Editable children\""
" in the menu. You don't need to do this to add new children nodes to this"
" node, but remember that these new children will belong to the instance, "
"not the 'template' scene. If you want to add new children to all the "
