"*GDScript* is a high level, dynamically typed programming language used "
"to create content. It uses a syntax similar to `Python "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29>`_ "
"(blocks are indent-based and many keywords are similar). Its goal is to "
"be optimized for and tightly integrated with Godot Engine, allowing great"
" flexibility for content creation and integration."

msgid "History"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/gdscript.rst:19
msgid ""
"Initially, Godot was designed to support multiple scripting languages "
"(this ability still exists today). However, only GDScript is in use right"
" now. There is a little history behind this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/gdscript.rst:23
msgid ""
"In the early days, the engine used the `Lua <http://www.lua.org>`__ "
"scripting language. Lua is fast, but creating bindings to an object "
"oriented system (by using fallbacks) was complex and slow and took an "
"enormous amount of code. After some experiments with `Python "
"<http://www.python.org>`__, it also proved difficult to embed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/gdscript.rst:29
msgid ""
"The last third party scripting language that was used for shipped games "
"was `Squirrel <http://squirrel-lang.org>`__, but it was dropped as well. "
"At that point, it became evident that a custom scripting language could "
"more optimally make use of Godot's particular architecture:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/gdscript.rst:34
msgid ""
"Godot embeds scripts in nodes. Most languages are not designed with this "
"in mind."

"Godot uses several built-in data types for 2D and 3D math. Script "
"languages do not provide this, and binding them is inefficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/gdscript.rst:38
msgid ""
"Godot uses threads heavily for lifting and initializing data from the net"
" or disk. Script interpreters for common languages are not friendly to "
"this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/gdscript.rst:41
msgid ""
"Godot already has a memory management model for resources, most script "
"languages provide their own, which results in duplicate effort and bugs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/gdscript.rst:44
msgid ""
"Binding code is always messy and results in several failure points, "
"unexpected bugs and generally low maintainability."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/gdscript.rst:47
msgid ""
"The result of these considerations is *GDScript*. The language and "
"interpreter for GDScript ended up being smaller than the binding code "
"itself for Lua and Squirrel, while having equal functionality. With time,"
" having a built-in language has proven to be a huge advantage."
