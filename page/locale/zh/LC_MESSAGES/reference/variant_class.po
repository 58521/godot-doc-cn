"Variant is the most important datatype of Godot, it's the most important "
"class in the engine. A Variant takes up only 20 bytes and can store "
"almost any engine datatype inside of it. Variants are rarely used to hold"
" information for long periods of time, instead they are used mainly for "
"communication, editing, serialization and generally moving data around."

"Both are implemented using variants. A Dictionary can match any datatype "
"used as key to any other datatype. An Array just holds an array of "
"Variants. Of course, a Variant can also hold a Dictionary and an Array "
"inside, making it even more flexible."

"Both have a shared mode and a COW mode. Scripts often use them in shared "
"mode (meaning modifications to a container will modify all references to "
"it), or COW mode (modifications will always alter the local copy, making "
"a copy of the internal data if necessary, but will not affect the other "
"copies). In COW mode, Both Dictionary and Array are thread-safe, "
"otherwise a Mutex should be created to lock if multi thread access is "
"desired."
