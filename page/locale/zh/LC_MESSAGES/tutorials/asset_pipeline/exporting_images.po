"It is often desired to do an operation to all or a group of images upon "

"**Convert Image Format**: Probably the most useful operation is to convert to "

"This section is similar to the previous one, except it can operate on a "
"selected group of images. When a image is in a group, the settings from the "
"global export options are overridden by the ones from the group. An image can "

"Grouping images allows a texture atlas to be created. When this mode is "
"active, a button to preview the resulting atlas becomes available. Make sure "
"that atlases don't become too big, as some hardware will not support textures "
"bigger than 2048x2048 pixels. If this happens, just create another atlas."

"The atlas can be useful to speed up drawing of some scenes, as state changes "
"are minimized when drawing from it (through unlike other engines, Godot is "
"designed so state changes do not affect it as much). Textures added to an "
"atlas get cropped (empty spaces around the image are removed), so this is "
"another reason to use them (save space). If unsure, though, just leave that "
"option disabled."
