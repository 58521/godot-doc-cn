"The world is full of different markets and cultures and, to maximize "

"In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is "
"usually located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games, "
"however, can use several orders of magnitude more text than "
"applications, so they must support efficient methods for dealing with "
"loads of multilingual text."
msgstr ""
"在常规的桌面或移动应用中，经过国际化的文本通常位于资源文件中(或者用于GNU"
"用途的.po文件)。然而，游戏可能使用比一般应用程序多出好几个数量级的文本，"
"因此它们必须支持高效的方法来处理多国语文本的载入。"

"There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and "
"applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use "
"one of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use "
"a specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for "
"development if a game is released first in English, later in other "
"languages, but a complete nightmare if working with many languages at "
"the same time."
msgstr ""
"有两种方法可以为游戏和应用生成多国语言。它们都是基于键:值体系(Key:Value "
"System)。第一种是使用一种语言作为键（一般是英语），第二种是使用某种标识。"
"如果游戏已经被首先发行为英文版的话，第一种方法开发起来更快，但如果是同时"
"处理很多语言的话，第一种方法就是噩梦了。"

"In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for "
"each string. This allows to revise the text while it's being translated "
"to others. The unique ID can be a number, a string, or a string with a "
"number (it's just a unique string anyway)."
msgstr ""
"一般地，游戏会使用第二种方法并对每一个字串使用一个唯一标识号(ID)。这样一"
"来就能够在别人翻译的时候进行修订了。这个唯一标识号可以是一个数字、一个字"
"符串或者是两者的混合（但不管怎么样，就是一个独一无二的字符串。）"
