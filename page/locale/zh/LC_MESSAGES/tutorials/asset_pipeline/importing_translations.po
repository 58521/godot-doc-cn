"The world is full of different markets and cultures and, to maximize "
"profits™, nowadays games are released in several languages. To solve "
"this, internationalized text must be supported in any modern game engine."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/asset_pipeline/importing_translations.rst:14
msgid ""
"In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is "
"usually located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games, "
"however, can use several orders of magnitude more text than applications,"
" so they must support efficient methods for dealing with loads of "
"multilingual text."

msgid ""
"There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and "
"applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use "
"one of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use a"
" specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for "
"development if a game is released first in English, later in other "
"languages, but a complete nightmare if working with many languages at the"
" same time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/asset_pipeline/importing_translations.rst:28
msgid ""
"In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for "
"each string. This allows to revise the text while it's being translated "
"to others. The unique ID can be a number, a string, or a string with a "
"number (it's just a unique string anyway)."

"To complete the picture and allow efficient support for translations, "
"Godot has a special importer that can read csv files. Both Microsoft "
"Excel and Google Spreadsheet can export to this format, so the only "
"requirement is that the files have a special arrangement. The csv files "
