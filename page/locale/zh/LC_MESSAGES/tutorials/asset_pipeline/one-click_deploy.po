"This feature will pop up automatically once a platform is properly "
"configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since "
"things can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured "

"know that it exists."

"the user to automatically export, install and run the project (in debug "
"mode) on the device. This feature is called, in industry buzz-words, "
"\"One Click Deploy\" (though, it's technically two clicks...)."
