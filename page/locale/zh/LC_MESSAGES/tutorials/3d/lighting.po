"As mentioned before, there are three types of light nodes: Directional, "
"Ambient and Spot. Each has different uses and will be described in "
"detail below, but first let's take a look at the common parameters for "
"lights:"

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:34
msgid "**Enabled**: Lights can be disabled at any time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:35
msgid ""
"**Bake Mode**: When using the light baker, the role of this light can be "
"defined in this enumerator. The role will be followed even if the light "
"is disabled, which allows to configure a light and then disable it for "
"baking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Energy**: This value is a multiplier for the light, it's specially "
"useful for :ref:`doc_high_dynamic_range` and for Spot and Omni lights, "
"because it can create very bright spots near the emissor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:42
msgid ""
"**Diffuse and Specular**: These light values get multiplied by the "
"material light and diffuse colors, so a white value does not mean that "
"light will be white, but that the original color will be kept."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:45
msgid ""
"**Operator**: It is possible to make some lights negative for a "
"darkening effect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:47

"**Projector**: Lights can project a texture for the diffuse light "
"(currently only supported in Spot light)."

msgid "Directional light"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:53
msgid ""
"This is the most common type of light and represents the sun. It is also "
"the cheapest light to compute and should be used whenever possible "
"(although it's not the cheapest shadow-map to compute, but more on that "
"later). Directional light nodes are represented by a big arrow, which "
"represent the direction of the light, however the position of the node "
"does not affect the lighting at all, and can be anywhere."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:62
msgid ""
"Basically what faces the light is lit, what doesn't is dark. Most lights "
"have specific parameters but directional lights are pretty simple in "
"nature so they don't."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:67
msgid "Omni light"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:69
msgid ""
"Omni light is a point that throws light all around it up to a given "
"radius (distance) that can be controlled by the user. The light "
"attenuates with the distance and reaches 0 at the edge. It represents "
"lamps or any other light source that comes from a point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:76
msgid ""
"The attenuation curve for these kind of lights in nature is computed "
"with an inverse-quadratic function that never reaches zero and has "
"almost infinitely large values near the emissor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:80
msgid ""
"This makes them considerably inconvenient to tweak for artists, so Godot "
"simulates them with an artist-controlled exponential curve instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Spot light"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:89
msgid ""
"Spot lights are similar to Omni lights, except they only operate between "
"a given angle (or \"cutoff\"). They are useful to simulate flashlights, "
"car lights, etc. This kind of light is also attenuated towards the "
"opposite direction it points to."

msgid "Ambient light"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:99
msgid ""
"Ambient light can be found in the properties of a WorldEnvironment "
"(remember only one of such can be instanced per scene). Ambient light "
"consists of a uniform light and energy. This light is applied the same "
"to every single pixel of the rendered scene, except to objects that used "
"baked light."

msgid "Baked light"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/3d/lighting.rst:108
msgid ""
"Baked light stands for pre-computed ambient light. It can serve multiple "
"purposes, such as baking light emissors that are not going to be used in "
"real-time, and baking light bounces from real-time lights to add more "
"realism to a scene (see Baked Light]] tutorial for more information)."
