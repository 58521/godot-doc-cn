"Godot supports a flexible and powerful :ref:`3D scene importer "
"<doc_importing_3d_scenes>` that allows for full scene importing. For a "
"lot of artists and developers this is more than enough. However, many do "
"not like this workflow as much and prefer to import individual 3D Meshes "
"and build the scenes inside the Godot 3D editor themselves. (Note that "
"for more advanced features such as skeletal animation, there is no option"
" to the 3D Scene Importer)."

"The 3D mesh import workflow is simple and works using the OBJ file "
"format. The imported meshes result in a .msh binary file which the user "
"can put into a :ref:`class_meshinstance`, which in turn can be placed "
"somewhere in the edited scene."

"This dialog allows the import of one more more OBJ files into a target "
"path. OBJ files are converted to .msh files. Files are imported without "
"any material on them, material has to be added by the user (see the "
":ref:`doc_fixed_materials` tutorial). If the external OBJ file is changed"
" it will be re-imported, while keeping the newly assigned material."

"A few options are present. Normals are needed for regular shading, while "
"Tangents are needed if you plan to use normal-mapping on the material. In"
" general, OBJ files describe how to be shaded very well, but an option to"
" force smooth shading is available."

"Finally, there is an option to weld vertices. Given OBJ files are text-"
"based, it is common to find some of these with vertices that do not "
"match, which results in strange shading. The weld vertices option merges "
"vertices that are too close to keep proper smooth shading."
