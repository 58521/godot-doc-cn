"Fixed materials (originally Fixed Pipeline Materials) are the most common"
" type of materials, using the most common material options found in 3D "
"DCCs (such as Maya, 3DS Max or Blender). The big advantage of using them "
"is that 3D artists are very familiar with this layout. They also allow to"
" try out different things quickly without the need of writing shaders. "
"Fixed Materials inherit from :ref:`Material <class_Material>`, which also"
" has several options. If you haven't read it before, reading the "
":ref:`doc_materials` tutorial is recommended."

"This flag needs to be active for transparent materials to blend with what"

"Vertex color painting is a very common technique to add detail to "

"Diffuse color is responsible for the light that reaches the material, "
