"So far, :ref:`Nodes <class_Node>` have been the most important datatype "
"in Godot, as most of the behaviors and features of the engine are "
"implemented through them. There is, though, another datatype that is "
"equally as important. That is :ref:`Resource <class_Resource>`."

"**Resources** are mere **data containers**. This means that they don't do"
" any action nor process any information. Resources just contain data."

"Examples of resources are :ref:`Texture <class_Texture>`, :ref:`Script "

"When Godot saves or loads (from disk) a scene (.scn or .xml), an image "
"(png, jpg), a script (.gd) or pretty much anything, that file is "
"considered a resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a resource is loaded from disk, **it is always loaded once**. That "
"means, if there is a copy of that resource already loaded in memory, "
"trying to load the resource again will just return the same copy again "
"and again. This corresponds with the fact that resources are just data "
"containers, so there is no need to have them duplicated."

"Typically, every object in Godot (Node, Resource, or anything else) can "
"export properties, properties can be of many types (like a string, "
"integer, Vector2, etc) and one of those types can be a resource. This "
"means that both nodes and resources can contain resources as properties. "
"To make it a little more visual:"

"Pressing the the \">\" button the right side of the preview, allows to "
"view and edit the resources properties. One of the properties (path) "

"When the resource comes from a file, it is considered an *external* "
"resource. If the path property is erased (or never had a path to begin "

"For example, if the path \\`\"res://robi.png\"\\` is erased from the "
"\"path\" property in the above example, and then the scene is saved, the "
"resource will be saved inside the .scn scene file, no longer referencing "
"the external \"robi.png\". However, even if saved as built-in, and even "
"though the scene can be instanced multiple times, the resource will still"
" always be loaded once. That means, different Robi robot scenes instanced"
" at the same time will still share the same image."

"Loading resources from code is easy, there are two ways to do it. The "
"first is to use load(), like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/step_by_step/resources.rst:92
msgid ""
"The second way is more optimal, but only works with a string constant "
"parameter, because it loads the resource at compile-time."

"Scenes are also resources, but there is a catch. Scenes saved to disk are"
" resources of type :ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>`, this means "
"that the scene is packed inside a resource."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/step_by_step/resources.rst:108
msgid ""
"To obtain an instance of the scene, the method "
":ref:`PackedScene.instance() <class_PackedScene_instance>` must be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/step_by_step/resources.rst:118
msgid ""
"This method creates the nodes in hierarchy, configures them (sets all the"
" properties) and returns the root node of the scene, which can be added "
"to any other node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/step_by_step/resources.rst:122
msgid ""
"The approach has several advantages. As the :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_instance>` function is pretty fast, adding extra "
"content to the scene can be done efficiently. New enemies, bullets, "
"effects, etc can be added or removed quickly, without having to load them"
" again from disk each time. It is important to remember that, as always, "
"images, meshes, etc are all shared between the scene instances."

"Resource extends from :ref:`Reference <class_Reference>`. As such, when a"
" resource is no longer in use, it will automatically free itself. Since, "
"in most cases, Resources are contained in Nodes, scripts or other "
"resources, when a node is removed or freed, all the children resources "
"are freed too."

"Like any object in Godot, not just nodes, resources can be scripted too. "

"containers."
