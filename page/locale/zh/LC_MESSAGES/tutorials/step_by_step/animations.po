"To begin, let's just use the scene from the previous tutorial "
"(:ref:`doc_splash_screen`). The goal will be to add a simple animation to"
" it. Here's a copy just in case: :download:`robisplash.zip "

"When a node of this type is selected, the animation editor panel will "

"Now this is when the magic happens! Several things happen when the "
"\"edit\" button is pressed, the first one is that the animation editor "

"But the second, and most important, is that the property editor enters "
"into \"animation editing\" mode. In this mode, a key icon appears next to"

"Next, the logo will appear from the top of the screen. After selecting "
