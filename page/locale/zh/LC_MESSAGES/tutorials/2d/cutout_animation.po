"Cut-out is a technique of animating in 2D where pieces of paper (or "
"similar material) are cut in special shapes and laid one over the other. "
"The papers are animated and photographed, frame by frame using a stop "
"motion technique (more info `here "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutout_animation>`__)."

"With the advent of the digital age, this technique became possible using "
"computers, which resulted in an increased amount of animation TV shows "
"using digital Cut-out. Notable examples are `South Park "

"Godot provides a few tools for working with these kind of assets, but "

#: ../../tutorials/2d/cutout_animation.rst:208
msgid ""
"This might seem strange at first, but will make sense later on. In "
"traditional skeleton systems, bones have a position, an orientation and a"

"just connect it to the parent**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now select the whole chain, from the endpoint to the arm and create bones:"
