"because a node to draw that-specific-something does not exist... it would"

"Basically, drawing a shape on screen requires it to be decomposed into a "
"certain number of points linked one to the following one. As you can "
"imagine, the more points your shape is made of, the smoother it will "
"appear, but the heavier it will be in terms of processing cost. In "
"general, if your shape is huge (or in 3D, close to the camera), it will "
"require more points to be drawn without showing angular-looking. On the "
"contrary, if you shape is small (or in 3D, far from the camera), you may "
"reduce its number of points to save processing costs. This is called "
"*Level of Detail (LoD)*. In our example, we will simply use a fixed "
"number of points, no matter the radius."

"Next step consists in computing the actual positions of these 32 points "
"that compose arc. This is done in the first for-loop: we iterate over the"
" number of points we want to compute the positions, plus one to include "
"the last point. We first determine the angle of each point, between the "
"starting and ending angles."

"The reason why each angle is reduced of 90° is that we will compute 2D "
"positions out of each angle using trigonometry (you know, cosine and sine"
" stuff...). However, to be simple, cos() and sin() use radians, not "
"degrees. The angle of 0° (0 radian) starts at 3 o'clock, although we want"
" to start counting at 0 o'clock. So, we just reduce each angle of 90° in "
"order to start counting from 0'clock."

"The actual position of a point located on a circle at angle 'angle' (in "
"radians) is given by Vector2(cos(angle), sin(angle)). Since cos() and "
"sin() return values between -1 and 1, the position is located on a circle"
" of radius 1. To have this position on our support circle, which has a "
"radius of 'radius', we simply need to multiply the position by 'radius'. "
"Finally, we need to position our support circle at the 'center' position,"
" which is performed by adding it to our Vector2 value. Finally, we insert"
" the point in the Vector2Array which was previously defined."

"Now, we need to actually draw our points. As you can imagine, we will not"
" simply draw our 32 points: we need to draw everything that is between "
"each of them. We could have computed every point ourselves using the "
"previous method, and draw it one by one, but this it too complicated and "
"inefficient (except if explicitly needed). So, we simply draw lines "
"between each pair of points. Unless the radius of our support circle is "
"very big, the length of each line between a pair of points will never be "
"long enough to see them. If this happens, we simply would need to "
"increase the number of points."

"Alright, we are now able to draw custom stuff on screen. However, it is "
"very static: let's make this shape turn around the center. The solution "
"to do this is simply to change the angle_from and angle_to values over "
"time. For our example, we will simply increment them by 50. This "
"increment value has to remain constant, else the rotation speed will "
"change accordingly."

"We also increment our angle_from and angle_to values here. However, we "
"must not forget to wrap() the resulting values between 0 and 360°! That "
"is, if the angle is 361°, then it is actually 1°. If you don't wrap these"
" values, the script will work correctly but angles values will grow "
"bigger and bigger over time, until they reach the maximum integer value "
"Godot can manage (2^31 - 1). When this happens, Godot may crash or "
"produce unexpected behavior. Since Godot doesn't provide a wrap() "

"The reason is that your GPU is actually displaying the frames as fast as "
"he can. We need to \"normalize\" the drawing by this speed. To achieve, "
"we have to make use of the 'delta' parameter of the _process() function. "
"'delta' contains the time elapsed between the two last rendered frames. "
"It is generally small (about 0.0003 seconds, but this depends on your "
"hardware). So, using 'delta' to control your drawing ensures your program"
" to run at the same speed on every hardware."

"In our case, we simply need to multiply our 'rotation_ang' variable by "
