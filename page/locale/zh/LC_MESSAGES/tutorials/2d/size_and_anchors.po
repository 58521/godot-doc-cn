"If a game was to be always run in the same device and at the same "
"resolution, positioning controls would be a simple matter of setting the "
"position and size of each one of them. Unfortunately, it is rarely the "
"case."
msgstr ""
"如果一个游戏只运行在一些分辨率相同的设备上，那就简单了，只需要设置各自的"
"坐标即可。不幸的是，这种情况几乎没有。"

"Only TVs nowadays have a standard resolution and aspect ratio. "
"Everything else, from computer monitors to tablets, portable consoles "
"and mobile phones have different resolutions and aspect ratios."
msgstr ""
"如今，只有电视拥有标准的分辨率和宽高比。其他设备，从pc到平板，从掌机到手"
"机都有不同的分辨率和宽高比。"

"There are several ways to handle this, but for now let's just imagine "
"that the screen resolution has changed and the controls need to be re-"
"positioned. Some will need to follow the bottom of the screen, others "
"the top of the screen, or maybe the right or left margins."
msgstr ""
"解决这些问题有很多方法，但是现在，让我们想象一下，当屏幕分辨率改变时，控"
"件需要重新定位。一些需要保持在屏幕底部，一些在屏幕顶部、左边或右边等等。"

"This is done by editing the *margin* properties of controls. Each "
"control has four margins: left, right, bottom and top. By default all of "
"them represent a distance in pixels relative to the top-left corner of "
"the parent control or (in case there is no parent control) the viewport."
msgstr ""
"通过设置控件的 *margin* 属性可以很容易实现。每个控件都有4个边距(margin)："
"left,right,top,bottom。默认情况下，它们表示控件相对于父级左上角(top-left)"
"的距离（单位：像素），如果没有父级，则相对于视窗左上角。"

"When horizontal (left,right) and/or vertical (top,bottom) anchors are "
"changed to END, the margin values become relative to the bottom-right "
"corner of the parent control or viewport."
msgstr ""
"当水平方向(left,right)或垂直方向(top,bottom)设置为 END 时，magin值就变为"
"相对于父级或视窗的右下角(bottom-right)定位。（可能描述得不是很清楚，自己"
"在编辑器里面试一试就会非常明白了）"

"Here the control is set to expand it's bottom-right corner with that of "
"the parent, so when re-sizing the parent, the control will always cover "
"it, leaving a 20 pixel margin:"

"Finally, there is also a ratio option, where 0 means left, 1 means right "
"and anything in between is interpolated."
msgstr "最后，也可以设置比例，0表示最左，1表示最右。"
