"If a game was to be always run in the same device and at the same "
"resolution, positioning controls would be a simple matter of setting the "
"position and size of each one of them. Unfortunately, it is rarely the "
"case."

"Only TVs nowadays have a standard resolution and aspect ratio. Everything"
" else, from computer monitors to tablets, portable consoles and mobile "
"phones have different resolutions and aspect ratios."

"There are several ways to handle this, but for now let's just imagine "
"that the screen resolution has changed and the controls need to be re-"
"positioned. Some will need to follow the bottom of the screen, others the"
" top of the screen, or maybe the right or left margins."

"This is done by editing the *margin* properties of controls. Each control"
" has four margins: left, right, bottom and top. By default all of them "
"represent a distance in pixels relative to the top-left corner of the "
"parent control or (in case there is no parent control) the viewport."

"When horizontal (left,right) and/or vertical (top,bottom) anchors are "
"changed to END, the margin values become relative to the bottom-right "
"corner of the parent control or viewport."

"Here the control is set to expand it's bottom-right corner with that of "
"the parent, so when re-sizing the parent, the control will always cover "
"it, leaving a 20 pixel margin:"

"Finally, there is also a ratio option, where 0 means left, 1 means right "
"and anything in between is interpolated."
