"For the sake of supporting as many platforms as possible, Godot only "
"accepts unix style path separators (``/``). These work everywhere, "
"including Windows."
msgstr ""
"为了尽可能多的支持更多的平台着想, Godot仅接受unix风格路径分融符 (``/``). "
"包括windows在引擎任何地方都一样的."

"As mentioned before. Godot considers that a project exists at any given "
"folder that contains an \"engine.cfg\" text file, even if such file is "
"empty."
msgstr ""
"就像以前说过的. Godot的工程存在于所给的包含\"engine.cfg\"文本文件的目录,"
"就算这个目录是空的也一样."

"Accessing project files can be done by opening any path with ``res://`` "
"as a base. For example, a texture located in the root of the project "
"folder may be opened from the following path: ``res://sometexture.png``."
msgstr ""
"任何可访问的工程文件都可以通过用``res://``这种路径作为根目录. 打个比方, "
"一个在根目录下的纹理文件可以用这样的路径名打开: ``res://sometexture."

"While the project is running, it is a very common scenario that the "
"resource path will be read-only, due to it being inside a package, self "
"contained executable, or system wide install location."
msgstr ""
"当一个工程正在运行, 资源路径是只读的, 这是一个很常见的情形, 由于在一个包"
"内, 它本身就包含可执行或者系统范围的安装路径."

"Storing persistent files in such scenarios should be done by using the "
"``user://`` prefix, for example: ``user://gamesave.txt``."
msgstr ""
"持久化存储的文件通常应该用``user://`` 作为前缀, 举个栗子: ``user://"
"gamesave.txt``."

"In some devices (for example, mobile ad consoles) this path is unique "
"for the app. Under desktop operating systems, the engine uses the "
"typical ~/.Name (check the project name under the settings) in OSX and "
"Linux, and APPDATA/Name for Windows."
msgstr ""
"在许多设备中 (打个比方, 移动广告终端) 对于app这个路径就是惟一的. 在桌面操"
"作系统中,  在OSX系统和Linux系统中引擎使用经典的 ~/.Name (项目设置检查一"
"下), 在windows系统中使用 APPDATA/Name."
