"For the sake of supporting as many platforms as possible, Godot only "
"accepts unix style path separators (``/``). These work everywhere, "
"including Windows."

"As mentioned before. Godot considers that a project exists at any given "
"folder that contains an \"engine.cfg\" text file, even if such file is "
"empty."

"Accessing project files can be done by opening any path with ``res://`` "
"as a base. For example, a texture located in the root of the project "
"folder may be opened from the following path: ``res://sometexture.png``."

"While the project is running, it is a very common scenario that the "
"resource path will be read-only, due to it being inside a package, self "
"contained executable, or system wide install location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/engine/data_paths.rst:33
msgid ""
"Storing persistent files in such scenarios should be done by using the "
"``user://`` prefix, for example: ``user://gamesave.txt``."

msgid ""
"In some devices (for example, mobile ad consoles) this path is unique for"
" the app. Under desktop operating systems, the engine uses the typical "
"~/.Name (check the project name under the settings) in OSX and Linux, and"
" APPDATA/Name for Windows."
