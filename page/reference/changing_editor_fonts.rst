Changing editor fonts
=====================

Godot allows changing the font for the editor, and the font for the code
editor. Both need to be in .fnt format, so they need to be imported
somewhere using the :ref:`font import tool <doc_importing_fonts>`.

Then copy or do whatever you want with the font, as long as the
location does not change, and set the relevant property in Editor
Settings. Code editor font is refreshed automatically, but the editor
needs to be restarted for the new global font to take effect.
